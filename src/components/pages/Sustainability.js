      <p className='paragraph'>NFT Logistics recognizes immense impact that our industry has on the environment. With years of experience in the industry, we have seen firsthand how environmentally harmful the supply chain industry can be. In order to combat this, we have chosen to “go green” in every way that we can. We have placed a major effort on sustainability in our warehouses and will continue to work towards a more sustainable future for our clients and customers. Currently, our sustainability efforts include usage of electric machinery and motion-sensor lighting.</p>
